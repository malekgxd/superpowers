# Conversation

Part of superpowers:brainstorming. Read it before your first message.

## Establish Shared Understanding

The outcome of brainstorming is an understanding your human partner can
recognize and correct, grounded in what they want to accomplish.

1. **Discover intent.** Use the request and available context to identify
   the intended outcome, who it is for, and what success looks like. When
   that information is missing, ask one focused question about purpose or
   intended use before proposing features or an approach. Knowing the app
   genre does not tell you why your partner wants it. Gathering missing
   requirements does not ask them to authorize the task again.
2. **Write back your understanding.** Summarize the intended outcome,
   relevant constraints, and success criteria in a short note your partner
   can assess. Separate what they said from assumptions. Invite correction
   and incorporate their answer before treating this as the design brief.
   On the architectural path the intent file is this write-back: write it
   with the Intent template in [architectural.md](architectural.md), not as a separate note.
3. **Carry intent into the design.** Preserve the agreed understanding in
   the selected path's design artifact: the written spec for architectural
   work, or the in-chat design/probe for bounded work and spikes. Check
   proposed features and technical choices against that understanding.

When the request already supplies the purpose and constraints, reflect
that understanding instead of asking the same questions again. Keep the
note concise; its accuracy and the opportunity to correct it matter.

## Asking

A first open question, for "a website for my bakery": "If it's mostly
for people deciding whether to stop by, I'd lead with hours and what's in
the case today; taking orders is a different site. What do you want
someone to do when they land on it?"

**Get them describing.** Open questions come first. Their own words carry
intent that your options can't. Offer a short menu only when they're
stuck. When they say "just guess" or "what do you think?", propose
something concrete.

**How it gets made.** Every project rests on choices about medium, tools,
materials, and resources: the platform, programming language, and
libraries for an app; the medium for a piece of art. Find out early which
of those choices they want to make, which they're handing to you, and what
they already have to work with. Someone with strong views or skills will
want to talk it through. Someone counting on you needs sensible defaults,
said in plain words. When there's existing work, build on what it already
uses. Any choice you make goes in the design as your call, never as
something they agreed to.

**Ground to cover.** This is territory, not a script. Never read these
out as questions:

- what kind of thing this is, and what makes it special
- why now, and what success looks like to them
- goals, non-goals, and anti-goals (what would make this a failure even
  if it technically works)
- prior art: what they've seen elsewhere, loved or hated
- current state: what exists now, what they've tried
- the details they care about

**Make every question specific** to their project and what they've told
you. Ask Socratically, the way a sharp colleague would: build each
question on their last answer or on something you found, so it helps
them think through a consequence or a case they may have missed
("Voting closes before the meeting, and two members joined this month.
Does someone who joins mid-round get a vote?"). When the reason isn't
already plain, say what you're hoping to learn or what the answer would
change. A proposal they can correct, plus your reason for it, often
beats a question.

**Show, don't tell.** Offer the visual companion (below) whenever seeing
would help more than reading:

- something they'll look at: a screen, a page, a printout, a sign
- a layout or arrangement: of a screen, a room, a schedule
- a flow or a sequence of steps
- options that would look different from each other
- a structure that's easier to see than read: a diagram, a timeline, a map

Once they've accepted, use it for mockups to react to, side-by-side
options, and throwaway prototypes they can click.

**Spike to feel things out.** Agentic work is waterfall, but very, very
fast. A quick throwaway build is often the cheapest way to learn what
they want or whether something works. Offer one when it would help.
When they just want to spike, get out of the way. Spikes get no tests
or minimal ones, aren't bulletproof, and skip the plan, implementation,
and review process. Bring what the spike taught you back into the
conversation. A spike during an architectural brainstorm is its own
task with its own yes; it may run before the intent commit because
nothing it builds is kept.

## Red Flags While Asking

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll offer a menu of what they might want" | Options steer. Ask them to describe it first. |
| "I'll fill in sensible defaults" | Good. Say them out loud. A default they never heard is one they couldn't reject. |
| "I should explain the process first" | Ask your question. The process shows itself. |

## Offering the Visual Companion

A browser tab for showing mockups, diagrams, and prototypes. It's a
tool, not a mode: accepting it doesn't send every question to the
browser.

**Offer it just-in-time.** Offer it the first time one of the Show,
don't tell moments comes up, never upfront. The offer is its own message
with nothing else in it — no clarifying question, summary, or other
content:

> "This might be easier if I show you. Want me to open a browser tab with some mockups?"

Wait for the user's response. If they accept, start the server with
`--open` so their browser opens to the first screen automatically. If
they decline, stay in text and don't offer again unless they raise it.

**Per question, ask: would they understand this better by seeing it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they accept, read [visual-companion.md](../visual-companion.md) before
starting the server.
